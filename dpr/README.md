## Purpose

This directory contains reusable DPR calculation helpers for the ranking project. It is not a replacement for review judgment: the output is a math checkpoint that must still be interpreted with source verification, action economy, concentration, target access, resource recovery, and table assumptions.

## Range And Burst Standards

- `近距` means the meaningful damage routine requires 15 feet or less.
- Finer range bands should still be recorded: `touch`, `5`, `10`, `15`, `30`, `60+`, `120+`.
- Burst routines should be labeled as `cold_start`, `prebuffed`, or `setup_amortized`.
- Resource recovery should be labeled as `long_rest`, `short_rest`, `encounter_low_cost`, or `sustained`.
- All-hit ceiling and expected damage are both useful. Use expected damage for ranking decisions first, then discuss all-hit ceiling, setup, resource cost, and repeatability.

## Current Engine

The calculator supports explicit benchmark routines. It does not infer class features automatically; the routine definition must already encode the legal attack, spell, resource, setup, and target assumptions.

Current primitives:

- attack bonus vs AC
- normal / advantage / disadvantage
- crit chance, expanded crit ranges, and doubled dice
- condition branches where any hit becomes a critical hit, such as attacking a Paralyzed target from within 5 feet
- repeated weapon or spell attack events
- sequential `Vex` attack chains where each hit can grant Advantage to the next attack
- saving throw damage, including half-on-save and no-damage-on-save
- direct damage that is conditional on another successful routine step
- AoE target counts
- per-hit riders such as `咒唤微元素群`, `魂灵环绕`, `神恩`, `猎人印记`, and `脆弱诅咒`
- multi-action samples such as `动作如潮`
- reference-CR percentage and tentative rank-pressure mapping

It intentionally does not automate every D&D rule. Add new primitives only when a review batch needs them.

## Reference Data

The calculator uses structured reference tables in `dpr/core/reference.py`, derived from the local `loot/dpr-ranking-reference.md` draft:

- PC level to reference CR for burst, sustained, close AoE, and ranged AoE.
- CR median HP, average HP, median AC, and median save bonuses.
- DPR percentage thresholds for tentative rank pressure.

The markdown draft remains the human-facing calibration note. The calculator reads the structured table so report generation is stable and not dependent on markdown parsing.

## Calibration Matrix

The calibration matrix keeps three assumption layers separate:

- `default`: ordinary optimized play without specific rare/very rare/legendary magic item dependency.
- `item_ceiling`: table-sensitive item branches such as `幻影师护臂`; these can show ceiling pressure but do not change the default rank.
- `condition_ceiling`: external state branches such as a Paralyzed target; these demonstrate kill ceiling and abuse potential, not ordinary DPR.

EX is not a fixed `% HP` threshold. In the matrix, EX requires horizontal dominance over same-level and same-category peers. The current dominance gate is at least S by threshold and at least `1.5x` the next comparable row. Vex remains supported by the calculator, but Vex-derived rows are excluded from this calibration pass unless a later review explicitly asks for stable Vex assumptions.

## CLI Usage

Generate the current benchmark report:

```powershell
python -m dpr.cli report --out loot/dpr-calculated-benchmarks.md
```

Print all current benchmark rows:

```powershell
python -m dpr.cli benchmark
```

Filter by level:

```powershell
python -m dpr.cli benchmark --levels 13-20 --category close_burst
```

Calculate one routine by id:

```powershell
python -m dpr.cli routine wizard-20-cme9-plus-scorching-ray8 --level 20
```

Use `--format json` on `routine` or `benchmark` for machine-readable output.

Generate the default/item/condition calibration matrix:

```powershell
python -m dpr.cli matrix
```

This writes ignored local files under `loot/`:

- `loot/dpr-calibration-matrix.md`
- `loot/dpr-calibration-matrix.json`

## Pilot Samples

Run:

```powershell
python -m dpr.examples.baselines
```

The current samples cover:

- 20级法师：9环 `咒唤微元素群` + 8环 `灼热射线`
- 勇气学院吟游诗人16 / 魔契师2 / 战士2：8环 `咒唤微元素群` with 7环 `灼热射线`, `魔能爆`, and `动作如潮`
- 20级奥法骑士：长柄武器 / `巨武器大师` / `魂灵环绕` / `动作如潮`

The newer CLI benchmarks are broader and should be preferred for ranking calibration.

Current benchmark notes:

- `勇气学院16 / 魔契师2 / 战士2` includes no-`幻影师护臂` Battle Magic variants for longbow and shortbow.
- It also includes an explicitly item-dependent `幻影师护臂` extreme branch with Spell Sniper, Dual Wielder, two scimitars, and Nick.
- The same extreme branch has a separate Paralyzed-target variant; it is condition-dependent and should not be treated as the ordinary DPR line.
- CME-bound weapon/ray/beam routines are categorized as `close_burst` or `close_sustained` when the added damage requires the target to be within 15 feet.
- Champion Fighter weapon attacks use expanded critical range in the relevant benchmark rows.
- Vex chains are stateful: if one attack misses, the next attack does not gain Vex Advantage from that missed attack.
